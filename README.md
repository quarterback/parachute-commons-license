# Parachute Commons License (PCL) 1.0

**🪂 A license that deploys protection as it gets closer to the ground**

*Version 1.0 | June 2025*  
*Built in the spirit of the original conceptual Parachute Public License*

## The Metaphor
A parachute stays packed until you need it. This license works the same way—starting permissive but deploying stronger protections when certain conditions are detected. The closer to "ground impact" (exploitation, automation, commercialization), the more restrictive it becomes.

---

## Phase 1: Free Fall (Default State)
**Open for human use, study, and remix**

✅ **You may:**
- Read, share, and study this work freely
- Remix, adapt, and build upon it for personal, educational, or research purposes
- Distribute with proper attribution

✅ **You must:**
- Include attribution to original human author(s)
- Link back to source when possible
- Preserve this license notice

---

## Phase 2: Chute Deployed (Triggered Protections)
**Activates when detecting proximity to exploitation**

⚠️ **Deployment triggers include:**
- Commercial use without permission
- Training AI/ML models on this content
- Mass scraping or automated ingestion
- Use by surveillance or deception systems
- Removal or obscuring of attribution
- Corporate appropriation for profit

🛡️ **Additional restrictions when deployed:**
- **AI/ML Training**: Prohibited without explicit opt-in consent
- **Commercial Use**: Requires written permission and revenue sharing
- **Attribution**: Must include "Protected under Parachute Commons License"
- **Derivatives**: Must disclose any AI involvement in creation
- **Corporate Use**: Prohibited for entities >50 employees without license upgrade

---

## Phase 3: Emergency Deployment (Hard Protection)
**Activates under severe misuse conditions**

🚨 **Emergency triggers:**
- Use in disinformation campaigns
- Training models that impersonate the author
- Use in systems causing demonstrated public harm
- Willful violation of attribution requirements
- Use by bad-faith actors after warning

🔒 **Full protection mode:**
- All use prohibited except by express written permission
- Original creator may demand removal/cessation
- Derivatives must be clearly marked as unauthorized
- Legal action explicitly authorized

---

## Detection & Enforcement
This license relies on:
- **Community reporting** of misuse
- **Self-disclosure** by good-faith actors
- **Creator vigilance** and periodic review
- **Cultural pressure** rather than legal enforcement alone

---

## Upgrade Path
Users can "upgrade" to more permissive use by:
- Obtaining explicit permission from creator
- Providing attribution in perpetuity
- Sharing revenue from commercial use
- Contributing back to the commons

---

## Technical Implementation
To use this license:

1. **Add to your repository:**
   ```
   LICENSE: Parachute Commons License 1.0
   Source: [this repo URL]
   ```

2. **Include in documentation:**
   ```markdown
   🪂 Licensed under Parachute Commons License
   Safe for human use • Deploys protection against exploitation
   ```

3. **Badge for websites:**
   ```html
   <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Parachute%20Commons-blue.svg" alt="Parachute Commons License">
   ```

## Why This Exists
We built this license because:
- Creative Commons was designed before AI training became extractive
- We need commons that protect creators without prohibiting sharing
- Attribution is collapsing in the age of AI slop
- Human creativity deserves adaptive protection

The commons should be a safe place to land, not a place to be strip-mined.

---

## Legal Note
This license is a social and moral framework first, legal framework second. It's designed to create cultural expectations and community standards. Legal enforceability varies by jurisdiction.

---

## Fork & Adapt
This license is itself released under its own terms. Fork it, adapt it, improve it. That's what the commons is for.
