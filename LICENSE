# Parachute Commons License (PCL) 1.0

🪂 A license that deploys protection as it gets closer to the ground

Version 1.0 • June 2025
Inspired by the original concept of the Parachute Public License.
Written for a world that forgot how attribution works.

---

## The Metaphor

Like a parachute, this license stays packed until you need it. It starts light and open, but if the descent gets dangerous—commercial grabs, mass scraping, vibes theft—it deploys protections. Not to lock things down, but to slow the fall and cushion the impact.

---

## Phase 1

**This is the default mode.** If you're a person reading, learning, sharing, or building on this work in good faith: welcome.

✅ You can:

* Read it, share it, use it in a class, remix it for your zine, build on it in a workshop
* Quote it, annotate it, make something weird or useful with it

✅ You must:

* Credit the original human author(s)
* Link back if it’s online
* Keep this license notice somewhere visible

---

## Phase 2

**If things start heading toward extraction, the chute opens.** Certain actions trigger a more guarded mode—not to punish reuse, but to call a time-out and demand reciprocity.

⚠️ Triggers:

* Commercial use without a heads-up
* Mass ingestion (especially by bots)
* Use in closed systems that strip credit
* Corporate repackaging or productization
* Hiding, obscuring, or deleting attribution

🛡️ In this mode:

* **Commercial use** requires permission and possibly a revenue split
* **Attribution** must clearly state: “Protected under Parachute Commons License”
* **Derivatives** must disclose if they were altered/generated by non-humans
* **Corporate/institutional use** (>50 employees) needs a license upgrade

---

## Phase 3

**This is for worst-case scenarios.**

🚨 Triggers:

* Use in misinformation, impersonation, or deception
* Willful misuse after being asked to stop
* Systems that actively cause harm or erase human authorship
* Appropriation by known bad-faith actors

🔒 In this mode:

* All use is prohibited unless specifically granted
* Derivative works must be labeled clearly as unauthorized
* Legal, reputational, or platform recourse is encouraged

---

## Enforcement Is Cultural

This license isn’t some overengineered DRM scheme. It works because people respect boundaries. Enforcement depends on:

* Community flagging
* Creators calling misuse out
* Responsible humans disclosing their intentions
* Shared norms over endless contracts

---

## Want to Do More?

If you want broader permission—especially for commercial, educational, or institutional use—here’s how to proceed:

* Ask the creator. They’ll probably say yes if you’re decent.
* Give ongoing credit and link back
* Consider sharing profit or inviting them in
* Contribute something back—code, writing, care, visibility

## How to Use This License

1. Add this to your repo:

   ```
   LICENSE: Parachute Commons License 1.0  
   Source: https://github.com/quarterback/parachute-commons-license
   ```

2. Mention it clearly in your README or doc:

   ```markdown
   🪂 This work is shared under the Parachute Commons License.  
   Starts open, deploys protection if needed.
   ```

3. Add a badge (optional, but it helps):

   ```html
   <img src="https://yourdomain.com/path-to/parachute-commons-badge.svg" alt="Parachute Commons License">
   ```

## Why We Made This

Because the defaults are broken.

Because too much gets scraped, remixed, monetized, and shoved into closed loops without a trace of the original hands that shaped it.

Because openness without protection isn’t generosity—it’s abandonment.

The commons needs guardrails. Not for hoarding, but for remembering where things came from—and who still cares.

---

## Legal Blah Blah

This isn’t a fortress. It’s a signal.
It invites responsibility, not litigation.
If you honor the spirit, the letter won’t matter.
If you don’t, the letter’s there when needed.
