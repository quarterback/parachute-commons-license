## The Metaphor

A parachute stays packed until needed. This license starts permissive, but opens up with stronger protections when certain risks are detected. The closer a work gets to harmful abstraction, mass replication, or unacknowledged appropriation, the more restrictive its terms become.

## Phase 1:

**Open for study, reflection, and shared contribution.**

‚úÖ **You may:**

* Read, share, and discuss this work freely
* Remix, adapt, and build upon it for personal, educational, or research use
* Distribute copies with proper attribution

‚úÖ **You must:**

* Credit the original human creator(s)
* Link to the original when possible
* Preserve this license text

## Phase 2: 

**Stronger terms apply when conditions risk distorting or exploiting the original.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Triggers include:**

* Commercial use without permission
* Automated ingestion at scale
* Mass replication or concealment of original authorship
* Institutional reuse without acknowledgment
* Use in systems that obscure provenance

üõ°Ô∏è **Once triggered:**

* **Commercial reuse** requires permission and fair compensation
* **Institutional use** requires contributor acknowledgment
* **Remixed works** must state their relationship to the original
* **Attribution** must visibly include: ‚ÄúProtected under Parachute Commons License‚Äù

## Phase 3: 

**For situations of egregious misuse.**

üö® **Triggers include:**

* Harmful impersonation
* Use in contexts that obscure or falsify the intent of the original
* Appropriation that violates the spirit of open contribution

üîí **Once triggered:**

* All use is suspended without written permission
* Derivative or impersonated works must be removed
* Legal or community-led interventions are permitted

## Enforcement & Culture

This license is maintained through:

* **Shared norms and community pressure**
* **Voluntary disclosure by responsible reusers**
* **Active care by original contributors**
* **A culture of honoring provenance**

## Reuse and Respect

To move into more flexible reuse:

* Request permission directly from the author
* Offer meaningful attribution and linkage
* Share value, credit, or learning with the originator or community

## Using This License

**To apply this license to your work:**

1. Add this notice to your project:

   ```
   LICENSE: Parachute Commons License 1.0
   Source: https://github.com/[your-username]/parachute-commons-license
   ```

2. Add a visible statement to your documentation:

   ```markdown
   ü™Ç This work is shared under the Parachute Commons License.  
   Designed for shared inquiry, protected from extractive use.
   ```

3. Add the badge to your repo or site:

   ```html
   <img src="https://yourdomain.com/path/to/parachute_commons_badge.png" alt="Parachute Commons License Badge">
   ```

## Why This Exists

This license was created in response to:

* The erosion of authorship in hyper-replicable environments
* The collapse of clear attribution in many contemporary knowledge systems
* A need for shared work to remain open without being exploited

It is a parachute, not a gate. A signal, not a straitjacket.
